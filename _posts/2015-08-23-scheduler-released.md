The Scheduler add-on has finally been released! To see demos, docs, and licensing information, go to [fullcalendar.io/scheduler]({{ site.baseurl }}/purchase)

A quick refresher: Scheduler is a premium add-on for FullCalendar that provides features related to _resources_ (things like team members or conference rooms). It comes with a new calendar view called _Timeline_ which portrays time left-to-right and resources top-to-bottom. This was a very [highly requested](https://code.google.com/p/fullcalendar/issues/detail?id=150) feature and it feels good to finally get it done. For more background information, view the [feature announcement post](http://blog.arshaw.com/1/post/2015/02/timeline-and-other-news.html).

### Pricing and Licensing

There are a number of license options that should accommodate a range of use-cases. For websites that are _not_ considered webapps or SaaS products, you can purchase a Website license. For use in more advance scenarios, Developer licenses are required. All licenses come with a year of email support and upgrades. For more information, [visit the pricing page]({{ site.baseurl }}/purchase).

Registered non-profit organizations are able to use Scheduler for free. For more information, visit the [license page]({{ site.baseurl }}/license/premium).

### It&#8217;s Open Source

Scheduler is open source. It is [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)-compatible. Anyone can modify the source code. However, there are restrictions on how one can redistribute modifications as well as what kinds of projects can use GPL&#8217;d code. For more information, [visit the license page]({{ site.baseurl }}/license/premium).

### What&#8217;s left to be done

An alternate type of resource view, [which is described in this ticket](https://code.google.com/p/fullcalendar/issues/detail?id=490), has yet to be implemented. This view portrays resources left-to-right and time top-to-bottom, similar to how the _agenda_ views look. This feature is a top priority for Scheduler. To receive updates, please subscribe to [this ticket](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-scheduler/issues/5).

### Thank you!

This feature has been in the works for a while and I want to thank everyone for being so patient and supportive. Because of this release, the FullCalendar project is stronger than ever.

### Oh yeah, FullCalendar v2.4.0

The standard version of FullCalendar has a new release. It contains some pretty highly requested features: the ability to specify the [vertical ordering of events](https://code.google.com/p/fullcalendar/issues/detail?id=364), the ability to create [custom buttons](https://code.google.com/p/fullcalendar/issues/detail?id=225), and [more control over the time-axis text](https://code.google.com/p/fullcalendar/issues/detail?id=946).
