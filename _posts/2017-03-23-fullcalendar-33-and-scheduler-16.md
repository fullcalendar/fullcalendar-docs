title: FullCalendar 3.3.0 and Scheduler 1.6.0
date: 2017-03-23T22:42:40+00:00

The latest releases of FullCalendar and Scheduler gives drastically more control over which dates are displayed within a view as well as which dates the user can interact with.

The most notable features:

* [visibleRange]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/visibleRange) &#8211; programmatic control over a view's date range
* [validRange]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/validRange) &#8211; restrict the user from interacting with certain dates
* [showNonCurrentDates]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/showNonCurrentDates) &#8211; enables/disables render of dates outside the current month

And much more! These improvements are available in the [core views]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs) as well as Scheduler&#8217;s [timeline]({{ site.baseurl }}/premium) and [vertical resource]({{ site.baseurl }}/js/fullcalendar-scheduler-1.6.0/demos/vertical-resource-view.html) views:

* [FullCalendar 3.3.0 full changelog »](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/releases/tag/v3.3.0)
* [Scheduler 1.6.0 full changelog »](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar-scheduler/releases/tag/v1.6.0)

## Docs Page

These new features have been fully document on the [docs page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs). By the way, have you seen the docs page recently? It&#8217;s a massive list of settings that is growing out of control. Next mini-project: tame this into something that&#8217;s much more navigable, especially for those new to the FullCalendar project.

Suggestions on how to restructure the docs are more than welcome!
