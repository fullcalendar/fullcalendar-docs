## FullCalendar (Standard Edition)

The standard release of FullCalendar is released under the
<a href='{{ site.fullcalendar_repo }}/blob/master/LICENSE.txt'>MIT License</a>,
which puts almost no restrictions
on how you can use it. <b>You can even freely use it in a commercial project.</b>
The only stipulation is that you leave the copyright header at the top of each file intact.
This is the same license that the <a href='http://jquery.com/'>jQuery project</a> uses.

## FullCalendar Scheduler

The <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/purchase'>FullCalendar Scheduler</a> add-on is released under different
licensing terms than the standard edition of Fullcalendar. There are more restrictions on how it can be used.
