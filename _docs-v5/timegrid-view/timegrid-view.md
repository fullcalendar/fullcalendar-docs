A TimeGrid view displays one-or-more horizontal days as well as an axis of time, usually midnight to midnight, on the vertical axis. The two predefined TimeGrid views are the **timeGridWeek** and **timeGridDay** views. They can be initialized in an [ES6 setup](initialize-es6) like so:

```js
import { Calendar } from '@fullcalendar/core';
import timeGridPlugin from '@fullcalendar/timegrid';
...
let calendar = new Calendar(calendarEl, {
  plugins: [ timeGridPlugin ],
  initialView: 'timeGridWeek'
});
...
```

Or you can choose to initialized the TimeGrid views [as a global bundle](initialize-globals):

```html
<link href='fullcalendar/main.css' rel='stylesheet' />
<script src='fullcalendar/main.js'></script>
<script>
...
var calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {
  initialView: 'timeGridWeek'
});
....
</script>
```

TimeGrid views of other durations can be made with a [custom view](custom-view-with-settings) with type `'timeGrid'`.

The following options are specific to TimeGrid view. However, there are numerous other options throughout the docs that affect the display of TimeGrid view, such as the [locale-related options](localization) and [date/time display options](date-display).
