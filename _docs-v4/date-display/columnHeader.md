title: columnHeader
---

Whether the day headers should appear. For the Month, Agenda, and Basic views.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, *default*: `true`
</div>

The default is to show these column headers, but if you would like to hide them, especially if you have a single-day view and you feel the column header is unnecessary, you can set it to `false`.
