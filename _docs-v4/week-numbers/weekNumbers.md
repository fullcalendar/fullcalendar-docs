Determines if week numbers should be displayed on the calendar.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, *default*: `false`
</div>

If set to `true`, week numbers will be displayed in a separate left column in the Month/DayGrid views as well as at the top-left corner of the TimeGrid views. [View a simple demo](weekNumbers-demo).

By default, FullCalendar will use the current locale's week number calculation method. To display other types of week numbers, see [weekNumberCalculation](weekNumberCalculation).
