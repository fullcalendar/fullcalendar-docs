title: Event Parsing
---

When you give your calendar event data, whether it's through [an array](events-array), [a json feed](events-json-feed), or the [addEvent method](Calendar-addEvent), you specify the event as a plain JavaScript object with properties. This object then gets "parsed" into a proper [Event Object](event-object) that is then exposed in other parts of the API, like the [event render hooks](event-render-hooks) method.

This article describes all the properties you may supply in your plain, pre-parsed object. To demonstrate the simplest case:

```js
var calendar = new Calendar(calendarEl, {
  events: [
    { // this object will be "parsed" into an Event Object
      title: 'The Title', // a property!
      start: '2018-09-01', // a property!
      end: '2018-09-02' // a property! ** see important note below about 'end' **
    }
  ]
})
```

Here are all the available properties, **all of which are optional**:

<table>

  <tr>
  <th>id</th>
  <td markdown='1'>
  String or Integer. Will uniquely identify your event. Useful for [getEventById](Calendar-getEventById).
  It will be converted to a string.
  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <th>groupId</th>
  <td markdown='1'>
  String or Integer. Events that share a `groupId` will be dragged and resized together automatically.
  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <th>allDay</th>
  <td markdown='1'>
  Boolean (`true` or `false`). Determines if the event is shown in the "all-day" section of the view, if applicable. Determines if time text is displayed in the event. If this value is not specified, it will be inferred by the `start` and `end` properties. See notes below.

  **Do not put quotes around this value**. That would make it a string, not a boolean.
  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <th>start</th>
  <td markdown='1'>
  Something [date-parseable](date-parsing). When your event begins. If your event is explicitly `allDay`, hour, minutes, seconds and milliseconds will be ignored.
  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <th>end</th>
  <td markdown='1'>
  Something [date-parseable](date-parsing). When your event ends. If your event is explicitly `allDay`, hour, minutes, seconds and milliseconds will be ignored. If omitted, your events will appear to have the default duration. See [defaultAllDayEventDuration](defaultAllDayEventDuration), [defaultTimedEventDuration](defaultTimedEventDuration), and [forceEventDuration](forceEventDuration) for more info.

  **Note: This value is exclusive.** For example, if you have an all-day event that has an `end` of `2018-09-03`, then it will span through `2018-09-02` and end before the start of `2018-09-03`.

## Events and Dates

There are 3 date-related properties of events to highlight:

### `allDay`

If an event object does not explicitly define an `allDay` value, FullCalendar will do its best to guess whether it is an all-day event or not. It will look at the `start` and `end` values of your supplied event, and if, for example, both are ISO8601 strings in the format `2018-09-01` without time parts, it will infer `allDay` as `true`. If the time parts of only `start` or `end` is provided, FullCalendar assumes that `allDay` is `false`.

### `start`

As defined above, this is the date when an event begins. In other words, the event starts from this given date value and continues onwards. This value specifies the **inclusive** start of the event. In effect, if `allDay` is not explicitly set to `true` and `start` is `2018-09-01`, internally, this is recognised as `2018-09-01T00:00:00`.

### `end`

As defined above, this is the date when an event finishes. In other words, the event continues up to this cut-off point in time. This value specifies the **exclusive** end of the event. Since the event is not expected to continue beyond the given `end` date it may also be described as non-inclusive.

Again, if `allDay` is not explicitly set to `true` and `end` is `2018-09-07`, internally this is recognised as `2018-09-07T00:00:00`. It is that point in time, at the final part of `2018-09-06` and beginning of `2018-09-07`. Also, this may be interpreted as `2018-09-06T23:59:59` or `2018-09-07T00:00:00`.

FullCalendar handles these dates in the same way as discussed in the [iCalendar Specifications (RFC 5545)](https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-6-1-event-component.html) and [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/events/list) documentation.

In summary, `start` date is **inclusive** while `end` date is **exclusive**. In order to avoid inconsistencies, applications should consider passing [ISO8601 strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) with datetime values for `start` and `end` dates to FullCalendar, if `allDay` is `false`.
