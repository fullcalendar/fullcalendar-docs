Whether to automatically scoll the scroll-containers during event drag-and-drop and date selecting.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, *default*: true
</div>

If enabled, the scroll container will automatically scroll once the mouse gets close to the edge.

Note: If the scrollable parent is not the `html` element, the class `.fc-scroller` needs to be applied to tell full calendar which element to scroll while dragging.
