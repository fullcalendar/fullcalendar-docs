---

The simplest way to get started is with FullCalendar's pre-built bundles and `<script>` tags:

- [Initializing with script tags](initialize-globals)

For larger projects, it's best to use some type of build system:

- [Initializing with an ES6 build system](initialize-es6)
- [Using TypeScript](typescript)

Also, FullCalendar integrates with popular front-end frameworks:

- [React "deep" integration](react) (supports Next)
- [Vue connector](vue) (supports Nuxt)
- [Angular connector](angular)
