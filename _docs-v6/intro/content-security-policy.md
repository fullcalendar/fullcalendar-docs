title: Content Security Policy (CSP)
---

If your application has a [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), there are some things to consider.


## Icon Font

FullCalendar's icon-font is embedded into its CSS with a `data:` protcol. You must whitelist the `data:` protocol for fonts:

```html
<meta http-equiv='Content-Security-Policy' content="font-src data:">
```

[This ticket](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/issues/5685) proposes moving to SVG icons to avoid this problem.


## Dynamically-Generated Styles

FullCalendar injects its own `<style>` tags onto the page. Your CSP might prohibit this. A workaround is to use a [nonce value](https://content-security-policy.com/nonce/).

On your server, generate a random nonce value (`abc123` in this example). Then, register it with your CSP. The following line achieves this while also whitelisting the icon-font mentioned above:

```html
<meta http-equiv='Content-Security-Policy' content="default-src â€¦; style-src 'nonce-abc123'; font-src data:">
```

```html
<script src='fullcalendar/dist/index.js'></script>
<script src='app/index.js'></script>
```

Starting with **v6.1.0**, FullCalendar is able to output nonce values.

By default, FullCalendar will scan for the first `nonce` attribute it sees in any `<script>` tag. It will use this nonce value when injecting its own `<style>` tags, essentially outputting `<style nonce='abc123'>`.

You may override this behavior by including a meta at the head of your page. It must have the name `csp-nonce`:

```html
<meta name='csp-nonce' content='qwerty456' />
```

For nonce values to be secure, they must be randomly generated on the server and only used once. Also note that nonces can allow attackers to bypass all other restrictions from the CSP. Consult documentation elsewhere on the web for best practices, e.g. [in the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#security-considerations).
